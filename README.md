# acnh-critter-calendar
Generates a list of critters that can be caught on your island.

Takes user inputs (name of island, your current date and time etc) and spits out all the critters that are currently available to catch.
Basic responsive but works best on desktop.

Created as a project for class.

Enjoy!
